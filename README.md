# NLP--Sentiment_Analysis_and_Summarization_of_Stock_News
Natural Language Processing AI-model driven sentiment analysis solution that will automatically process and analyze news articles to gauge market sentiment, and summarizing the news at a weekly level to enhance the accuracy of their stock price predictions and optimize investment strategies.

I experimented with specific configurations and classifiers to optimize a model's tuning parameters and training with different classifiers. Additionally, I used different available TPU's and GPUs to determine processing tradeoffs with cost and speed: # To manipulate and analyze data: pandas, numpy. # To visualize data: matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn. # To parse JSON data: json. # To build, tune, and evaluate ML models: sklearn.ensemble: GradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier sklearn.model_selection: GridSearchCV, sklearn.metrics: confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score. # To load/create word embeddings: gensim.models, Word2Vec; KeyedVectors, gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec, glove2 word2vec. # To work with transformer models: torch, sentence_transformers # To summarize with NLP models: Llama Mistral-7B max_tokens, temperature, top_p, top_k.
